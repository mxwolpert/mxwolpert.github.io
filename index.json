To date, I have conducted research on sentence processing in Basque, French, English, and Mandarin and tested participants who are monolinguals, second language learners, and first language attriters. I myself am a reformed monolingual English speaker trying to make up for lost time by living my personal and professional life in different languages.\nI am curious about the potential for real-time parsing to be impacted by language experience ‚Äì although humans generally share the basics of neural architecture and language itself is confined to the limits of this existing architecture, we know that there is vast variability among languages for how sounds, sequences, and sense are expressed. Is this variability such that core processing mechanisms are different among languages?\nTo address this and related questions, I use EEG and behavioral experiments to test processing of a variety of sentence types. I am interested in what the mind is doing at the millisecond level at incremental moments in a sentence. As one of the most complex feats of human cognition, language can teach us about how the brain uses rules, manages multiple levels of information, and learns and forgets.\nAlongside my research, I am passionate about science as a tool for fostering collaboration and people-to-people connections across borders and across geopolitical tensions. My research training has taken me from the US to Spain, Canada, and China, and I am eager to take part in open and global science initiatives.\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am an early career researcher studying basic mechanisms of sentence processing across diverse languages and diverse language experiences.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

How adjectives are arranged and modified within a sentence, however, varies among languages. Steinhauer (2014) found that violations of adjective-noun order in English elicit biphasic N400-P600 ERP responses. Importantly, advanced learners of English showed a similar pattern to their native counterparts, suggesting these structures are processed by a similar mechanism in both native and non-native English speakers. This native-like processing by non-native English speakers was present whether their first language had adjective-noun order (i.e., Mandarin) or noun-adjective order (i.e., French).\nAlthough native and non-native English speakers have been shown to have the same ERP response to adjective placement violations, it is not trivial whether this finding should extend to Mandarin adjective placement. Although they typically precede the nouns they modify, Mandarin adjectives have different properties from English, and may frequently occur in predicate position without an intervening copula. For example, it is possible to say both Á≠âÁªøÁÅØ‰∫Ü ‚Äúwait green light‚Äù and Á≠âÁÅØÁªø‰∫Ü ‚Äúwait light green.‚Äù This variety in adjective placement can communicate subtle differences in meaning.\nWe tested processing of Mandarin adjective-noun pairs in both native and non-native speakers. We constructed sentences such that the structure licensed only adjective-noun order and not noun-adjective order (e.g., Áà∂‰∫≤ÊúÄËøëÊÉ≥ÁúãÊñ∞‰π¶‰∫Ü ‚Äúfather recently wants to read new books‚Äù). For native speakers, we found the same N400-P600 pattern as previously reported for English, but with an additional N400 effect on the adjective in the correct word order. A possible explanation for this additional effect is a difference in the lexical nature of adjective-noun pairs between Mandarin and English. For non-native speakers, the incorrect adjective placement elicited only an N400 effect with no subsequent P600, a pattern that is consistent with relatively low second language proficiency.\nAlongside these group-level results, we found more insight by considering individual differences in N400 and P600 amplitudes. Both native and non-native participants showed a range of responses, from N400-dominant, to biphasic, to P600-dominant. With this response range, there still was not a correlation between any behavioral measure and ERP amplitude. These results add more nuance to existing discussion on N400-P600 effects in individual differences (e.g., Tanner \u0026amp; Van Hell, 2014 and Fromont, Steinhauer, \u0026amp; Royle, 2020).\nNote that we used single-morpheme adjectives that can be paired with nouns without the particle ÁöÑ DE. These structure are considered to be undergoing a process of lexicalization and so may be qualitatively different from more typical adjective-DE-noun structures, especially when considering sentence processing.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e6c24dd71e39282a261bff0ef4a5a4dd","permalink":"mxwolpert.github.io/projects/adjective-placement/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"mxwolpert.github.io/projects/adjective-placement/","section":"projects","summary":"prenominal and postnominal","tags":null,"title":"Adjective placement","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Relevant Publications\nWolpert M, Ao J, Zhang H, Baum S, Steinhauer K, soon to be submitted | The child the apple eats ‚Äì processing of argument structure in Mandarin verb-final sentences Relations between verbs and their arguments are the foundation of sentence structure, and languages vary extensively in how these relations are expressed. English, for instance, relies almost entirely on word order to communicate agent and patient roles, and word order will generally ‚Äúwin‚Äù over other cues for interpretation in the case of ambiguity or competition with other cues.\nWe can test cue competition by using strange sentences like ‚ÄúThe child the apples eats.‚Äù In this sentence, the verb ‚Äúeats‚Äù is inflected for 3rd-person singular and semantic knowledge contends that apples cannot eat children. However, despite the cues of verb inflection and semantic knowledge, most English speakers interpret this sentence to mean that ‚Äúapples‚Äù is the noun doing the eating, merely by virtue of directly preceding the word.\nWhat is your own interpretation of this strange sentence? If you speak a language other than English, you may be informed by cue weighting parameters of your other language. For instance, Mandarin allows both subject-object-verb and object-subject-verb word orders, as well as lacking inflection for subject-verb agreement. Accordingly, semantic knowledge and context drive Mandarin sentence comprehension, so Mandarin speakers often opt for the semantically appropriate agent of the verb.\nTo study the fundamentals of argument structure processing, we had Mandarin monolinguals read sentences with a variety of grammatical and semantic manipulations (word order, presence of coverb, agent animacy, reversibility of the semantic event) while we recorded their EEG activity. We found that there is a language-specific profile of cue weighting that is more nuanced than a simple linear ranking, and even within a language there is individual variability in sentence comprehension strategies. EEG data showed that comprehenders likely do not wait until the verb to make argument structure decisions, and sentences whose grammar violates semantic knowledge elicit a brainwave pattern consistent with models that predict crosslinguistic differences in core processing mechanisms for sentence comprehension.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"1129d1c05f48aed60bc1a7a53473a3ad","permalink":"mxwolpert.github.io/projects/argument-structure/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"mxwolpert.github.io/projects/argument-structure/","section":"projects","summary":"core mechanisms of sentence processing","tags":null,"title":"Argument structure","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Relevant Publications\nGilbert A, Lee J, Coulter K, Wolpert M, Kousaie S, Gracco V, Klein D, Titone D, Phillips N, Baum S, 2021 | Spoken Word Segmentation in First and Second Language: When ERP and Behavioral Measures Diverge Gilbert A, Wolpert M, Saito H, Kousaie S, Itzhak I, Baum S, 2019 | Adaptive and selective production of syllable duration and fundamental frequency as word segmentation cues by French-English bilinguals Unlike the words on this page, there are not discrete boundaries between words and phrases in natural speech. To properly segment and parse sentences, listeners use a combination of top-down (e.g., knowledge of words) and bottom-up (e.g., prosodic cues) information as signals for dividing speech into comprehensible components. Speakers must also consider this information when producing utterances to make sure their listeners understand.\nAs if speech segmentation were not already a difficult enough task, the acoustic cues for signalling boundaries also vary among languages! French, for instance, uses a large pitch contrast and lengthening to signal word and phrase offsets, while English relies more on lengthening and subtle differences in lexical stress. These crosslinguistic differences can lead to difficulty for second language learners to produce and comprehend appropriate segmentation cues. According to some accounts, the prosodic cues used for segmentation are perceptually wired in the brain in early life and resistant to modification by later life experience. In this way, whatever an individual‚Äôs native language is will drive their automatic segmentation strategies in whatever language they learn. Others support the idea that the brain can adapt to use appropriate non-native segmentation cues in a second language.\nOur own data suggest that experience and language dominance may indeed be more important than nativeness. When we extend consideration to brain data as well, the picture becomes even more nuanced. EEG data further show that the brain can be sensitive to segmentation cues even when an individual cannot demonstrate this sensitivity behaviorally.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a1cf936d382371bbcf8b5649e5d69f5c","permalink":"mxwolpert.github.io/projects/bilingual-speech-segmentation/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"mxwolpert.github.io/projects/bilingual-speech-segmentation/","section":"projects","summary":"prosodic cues for word boundaries","tags":null,"title":"Bilingual speech segmentation","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Relevant Publications\nCaffarra S, Wolpert M, Scarinci D, Mancini S, 2020 | Who are you talking to? The role of addressee identity in utterance comprehension Wolpert M, Mancini S, Caffarra S, 2017 | Addressee Identity and Morphosyntactic Processing in Basque Allocutive Agreement Sentence processing does not rely solely on syntax and semantics ‚Äì pragmatics, or information that is not directly present in the linguistic message (i.e., suprasegmental), is also an essential part of language. Pragmatic information includes the interlocutor identity. Knowing who is saying something may be just as important as what is said. Some languages challenge the distinction of pragmatics as suprasegmental by directly encoding pragmatic information in the grammar.\nWe took advantage of such a linguistic feature in Basque where non-argument interlocutor information is encoded in morphosyntax, called allocutive agreement. This allocutive agreement occurs in the informal register hika, which is traditionally used only between the closest of friends, but has since enjoyed greater use and may be a signifier of a strong Basque identity. In allocutive agreement, there is obligatory inflectional agreement between 3rd person auxilary verbs and the gender of the addressee when the addressee is not an argument of the verb. We used conversations where allocutive verb forms were either congruent or incongruent with addressee identity, while using reaction time and ERPs to measure participants‚Äô detection of the allocutive agreement violation.\nAlthough other research has shown that speaker identity impacts comprehension at the earliest levels of processing, our data suggest that not all pragmatic information is so salient. Instead, knowledge about the identity of non-speaker interlocutors, including the addressee, may only influence processing at later stages.
